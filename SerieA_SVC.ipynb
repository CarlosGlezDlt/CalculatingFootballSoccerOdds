If you want to replicate the code and get the exact same results, you need to use the xlsx files that are in the repo (merged_df_serieA, games_serieA, baseprueba2_serieA). If you run the code not using those files, you will get different results because, at this time, it is half-season and as games continue, stats and match results will be updated. At the same time, the accuracy of the model should be higher in the end stages of the season and lower at the beginning, so it is better to make the calculations after around the first 8 or more week games. Last but not least, if you want to know the meaning of each variable in fbref data you should visit the website.\n\nLast but not least, if you want to know the meaning of each variable in the fbref data, you should visit the website.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"50aa65fc-dbf6-412d-a580-17744d1504c1"},{"source":"First, load the Python modules that are going to be
